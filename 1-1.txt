Mongo
- Open Soure- SQL Database
- Document Oriented
- Great for unstructured data, especially when you have a lot of it.

*In Mongo DOCUMENTS are stored in COLLECTIONS which are stored in DATABASES.
    MongoDB is document oriented
    
    Each DOCUMENT in a COLLECTION exists independently and they can have different fields
    which is referred to as a "dynamic schema"
    
    DOCUMENTS are just JSON like OBJECTS.  They consist of filled value pairs
        {
            "name": "invisibility",
            "vendor": "kettlecooked"
            }

RELATIONAL VERSUS DOCUMENTS ORIENTED

- Relational Database Management Systems save data in rows within tables

***WE CAN ACCESS MONGODB THROUGH THE TERMINAL APPLICATION***
    **all instances of mongo come with a command line app called THE SHELL (a js interpreter
    that lets us write js code)**
    
        var potion = 
        {   "name": "invisibility",
            "vendor": "kettlecooked"
            }
            
            
use reviews - switches to use the database and creates it if it doesnt exist when we write to it.
- reviews being the name of the database as an example

db - checks which database we're currently using

help - type this if I forget a command and it will give me a list of helpful commands.

show dbs - gives list of databases and their names and sizes

TO SAVE A DOCUMENT INTO A COLLECTION AND THEN SAVE IT TO THE DATABASE:

db.potions.insert(
{"name": "invisibility",
 "vendor": "kettlecooked"
     })
     
*Note for above code.  
    Whenever you want to interact with the database, use db first, then after
    you'd write the name of the document, then insert.  
    If the collection doesn't exist yet, it will automatically be created

You will receive a WriteResult back which lets you know if you succeeded inserting the
documents.  It will look like this:

WriteResult({ "ninserted": 1)}    ----this shows you successfully inserted 1 document
        

TO FIND DOCUMENTS IN THE DATABASE OF THAT COLLECTION

db.potions.find()

Even if you have no parameters always end it in parenthesis like in code above.

MongoDB requires that each document has a unique id.  If we don't specify one it 
automatically assigns one for us
